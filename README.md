If my PT/Ponytown character name has ''B/W for me to draw ya/Disc req'' and I have a ''afk'' or ''moon'' sign, it is because I am in the middle of drawing someone. 
My pronouns are he/him and they. Please do respect that.
Please DO NOT ship me with someone named ''iiddkk'' and the socials with ''glenne akisha belle'' they are my sister.
I will say ALOT of rude things if your mean to my sister, I do not care if i get banned.I
Im a Filipino speaker. If you do not know what im saying dont be shy to ask me to speak english
