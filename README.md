If my PT/Ponytown character name has ''B/W for me to draw ya/Disc req'' and I have a ''afk'' or ''moon'' sign, it is because I am in the middle of drawing someone. 
My pronouns are he/him and they. Please do respect that.
Please DO NOT ship me with someone named ''iiddkk'' and the socials with ''glenne akisha belle'' they are my sister.
I will say ALOT of rude things if your mean to my sister, I do not care if i get banned.
If I am speaking Filipino language or: looking at you with my friend, im rather saying mean stuff about you.
